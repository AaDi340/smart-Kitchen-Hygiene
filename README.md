# Smart Kitchen Hygiene Monitoring System

This project is a **computer vision-based hygiene monitoring system** that detects:
- **Vegetable freshness or cleanliness**
- **Kitchen platform cleanliness**
- **Cook/staff cleanliness (clean vs unclean)**

Initially, the system uses **AI-generated datasets** and a **laptop webcam** for detection. Later, hardware components (gas leakage sensor, temperature sensor, air quality sensor, etc.) will be integrated.
